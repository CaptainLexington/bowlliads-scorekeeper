## FAQ
* **What is bowlliards?**
  [Bowlliards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowlliards) is a cue sport with rules analogous to ten-pin bowling. Ten balls are racked at the beginning of each frame; each player is given two chances to sink as many balls in a run as possible. When the two turns are exhausted, the balls are racked again and player passes to the next player. A comprehensive set of rules can be found at [bowlliards.com](http://www.bowlliards.com/how-to-play/).

* **What is bowlliards-scorekeeper?**
  Bowlliards-scorekeeper is an application for desktop and mobile devices that scores your game automatically, like scorekeeping software ubiquitous in modern bowling alleys.

* **If the scoring is the same as a bowling, why have a separate app for bowlliards?**
  Bowling scorekeeping software is quite commonplace, but it is quite geared towards bowling. They generally require detailed information about what pins have been knocked down and so forth, so that this data can be analyzed and used to offer personalized advice. Obviously, this kind of data is not useful to a gamesman engaged in the game of bowlliards.

* **What about current bowlliards scorekeeping solutions?**
  They are either of low quality or available on limited platforms.

* **That seems like a weak justification.**
  Well, I really just wanted to learn LambdaNative.
